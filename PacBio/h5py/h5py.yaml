  readme: 'The h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface to the HDF5

    library from Python. The low-level interface is intended to be a complete

    wrapping of the HDF5 API, while the high-level component supports  access to

    HDF5 files, datasets and groups using established Python and NumPy concepts.


    A strong emphasis on automatic conversion between Python (Numpy) datatypes and

    data structures and their HDF5 equivalents vastly simplifies the process of

    reading and writing data from Python.


    Supports HDF5 versions 1.8.4 and higher.  On Windows, HDF5 is included with

    the installer.'
