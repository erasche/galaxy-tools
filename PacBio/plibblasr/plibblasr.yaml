  readme: 'BLASR Library

    =============


    | This repository contains an (incomplete) refactor of core BLASR code

    that

    | compiles into a library. The idea being that other programs needing

    access

    | to BLASR-like functionality can build it right-in instead of forking

    out

    | to a ''blasr'' executable. This has the advantages of enabling tighter

    | integration points within your program flow, eliminates the need for

    | HDF libraries to be installed, among others.


    | This first release contains all the basics to enable a sparse dynamic-

    | programming alignment between two sequences. The plan is to eventually

    fold

    | this back into the main BLASR code base, clean up the interface and

    document

    | it more thoroughly.
