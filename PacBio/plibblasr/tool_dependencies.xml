    <readme>BLASR Library
=============

| This repository contains an (incomplete) refactor of core BLASR code
that
| compiles into a library. The idea being that other programs needing
access
| to BLASR-like functionality can build it right-in instead of forking
out
| to a 'blasr' executable. This has the advantages of enabling tighter
| integration points within your program flow, eliminates the need for
| HDF libraries to be installed, among others.

| This first release contains all the basics to enable a sparse dynamic-
| programming alignment between two sequences. The plan is to eventually
fold
| this back into the main BLASR code base, clean up the interface and
document
| it more thoroughly.
